# Face Recognition using Haar-Cascade Classifier, Local Binary Pattern Histogram, OpenCV, and Python
Real Time Front and Side Face Recognition algorithm using Python and OpenCV

## Requirement
- Python 3.7
- OpenCV 3.4.3
- Numpy

## Outline
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:
1. Creating datasets (face_datasets.py)
2. Train the model (training.py)
3. Face Recognition (face_recognition.py)

## How to run ?
1. Run the face_dataset front/profile(side face) to create the datasets for face recognition
2. If you have more face to be include, change the ID and run the program again
3. Train your datasets by running training.py
4. Lastly, run face_recognition.py
5. Output of the recognition also would be saved on "result" folder which consist of the video capture and the text file of running time recognized face 
 
## Tips 
- You also can Google the syntax, and read the explanation from OpenCV Documentation.
